A [dependencies.io](https://www.dependencies.io)
[collector](https://www.dependencies.io/docs/collectors/)
that detects what version of WordPress is installed in a directory.

## Usage

This assumes you have all of the WordPress installation files in a directory
in your repo. The `path` should point to that directory.

### .dependencies.yml

```yaml
collectors:
- type: php-wordpress-core
  path: /
  actors:
  - ...
```

### Works well with

- [php-wordpress-core actor](https://www.dependencies.io/docs/actors/php-wordpress-core/) ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/dependencies-io/actor-php-wordpress-core/))

## Support

Any questions or issues with this specific collector should be discussed in [GitHub
issues](https://github.com/dependencies-io/collector-php-wordpress-core/issues). If there is
private information which needs to be shared then you can instead use the
[dependencies.io support](https://app.dependencies.io/support).
