##### How often will it check my dependencies?

We check each repo twice a day. You can manually trigger a build if you need to
re-run something or are working on building your own collector or actor.

<!-- ##### Can I use a custom image (collector/actor) without being a **Business** user?

Not currently. Allowing users to run their own docker images on our
infrastructure is a privileged feature. Features like that can be easily misused
and abused, so we have to set some barriers for who can use it. If you're in
need of those features, you can mostly likely afford the Business plan and will
get good value out of it. [If you have questions or concerns about pricing, we'd
be happy to talk with you]({{< relref "contact.html" >}}).

##### Can open-source use custom images?

No (related to question above). If you're working on open-source and feel like
there's a collector or actor that we're missing, help us build it! All of our
images are open-source and we welcome contributions of all kinds!

##### Why aren't open-source repos free with unlimited usage?

Because the dependencies.io platform is so flexible, we can't guarantee how
people will use it. If you've got a legitimate open-source project which
absolutely can not afford to pay for this service, contact us and we can see if
there's anything we can do. -->
