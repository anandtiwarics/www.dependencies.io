            <h3>Automated Builds</h3>
            <p>
                Every day, week, or month dependencies.io will checkout
                your repo and run a "build". Each build will run a series of
                <a href="#collectors">collectors</a> and <a href="#actors">actors</a> to
                read and update your dependencies.
            </p>

            <h3 id="collectors"><span class="step">Step 1</span> Collectors</h3>
            <p>
                Collectors are the first step in each build. Their job is to
                determine what you have installed, and which versions are
                available. Each collector is a Docker container, and can have
                any software installed that it needs.

                Once we know what versions to <a href="#actors">act</a> on,
                dependencies.io will use a custom algorithm to track down
                the best release notes that we can find. That information is
                then handed to the <a href="#actors">actors</a> so that we can
                send you the most informative notifications possible.

            <h3 id="actors"><span class="step">Step 3</span> Actors</h3>
            <p>
                With release notes in-hand, actors can notify you however you like.
                Pull requests can deliver the update straight to your repo, and
                can even run custom commands that are specific to your workflow.
                If you'd rather handle updates yourself then you can use
                <a href="/docs/actors/repo-issue/">issues</a>, <a href="/docs/actors/slack/">Slack</a>,
                or other types of notifications to kick-start the conversation
                and let everyone know what's available.
